# AWS CloudFormation Templates

[CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that enables modeling and setting up resources inside AWS in an automated fashion.


You can use these templates as-is or as building blocks for customizing your own templates.

**Notes:**

* You must accept the Software Terms of the relevant Check Point Product AMI in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/) at least once prior to launching the CloudFormation templates. It is not required to actually launch the instance from the Marketplace, but the agreement must be accepted from this location.

* Some stacks may "roll back" automatically after 1 hour, with an error "WaitCondition timed out" If this happens, please check Internet access is working, either through AWS (Internet Gateway (IGW) assigned to the VPC, routetables with a default route and assigned to the relevant subnet(s), and Elastic IP (EIP) assigned, etc), or through another method like external proxy, or route to on-prem, for example.
