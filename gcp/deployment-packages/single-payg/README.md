# GCP Deployment Manager package for Management, Gateway and Standalone PAYG solutions
This directory contains CloudGuard IaaS deployment package for Management, Gateway and Standalone PAYG solution published in the [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/checkpoint-public/check-point-cloudguard-payg).

# How to deploy the package manually
To deploy the Deployment Manager's package manually, without using the GCP Marketplace, follow these instructions:
1. Clone or download the files in this directory
2. Fill variables in the config.yaml(see below for variables descriptions).
3. Log into [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
4. [Activate Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloud-shell)
5. Set your Cloud Platform project in the Cloud Shell session use:
        
        gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
6. Upload the content of the CloudGuardIaaS/gcp/deployment-packages/single-payg/ directory to the [cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/uploading-and-downloading-files) 
7. Launch deployment by running:
        
         gcloud deployment-manager deployments create [DEPLOYMENT_NAME] --config config.yaml
8. Make sure the deployment finished successfully. <br>Example of successful deployment output:
