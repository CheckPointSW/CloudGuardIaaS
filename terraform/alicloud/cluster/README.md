# Check Point CloudGuard Network Security Cluster Terraform module for AliCloud

Terraform module which deploys a Check Point CloudGuard Network Security Cluster into an existing VPC.

These types of Terraform resources are supported:
* [Security group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/security_group.html)
* [Network interface](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/network_interface.html)
* [EIP](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/eip.html) - conditional creation
* [Route_entry](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/route_entry.html) - Internal default route: conditional creation
* [Instance](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/instance.html) - Gateway Instances
* [RAM Role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aliyun/alicloud/latest/docs/resources/ram_role)

## Note
- Make sure your region and zone are supporting the gateway instance types in **modules/common/instance_type/main.tf**
  [Alicloud Instance_By_Region](https://ecs-buy.aliyun.com/instanceTypes/?spm=a2c63.p38356.879954.139.1eeb2d44eZQw2m#/instanceTypeByRegion)
  
## Configuration
- Best practice is to configure credentials in the Environment variables - [Alicloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aliyun/alicloud/latest/docs)
```
Configure environment variables in Linux:

$ export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY=anaccesskey
$ export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY=asecretkey
$ export ALICLOUD_REGION=cn-beijing

Configure envrionment variables in Windows:
  set ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY=anaccesskey
  set ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY=asecretkey
  set ALICLOUD_REGION=cn-beijing

```

## Usage
- Fill all variables in the cluster/**terraform.tfvars** file with proper values (see below for variables descriptions).
- From a command line initialize the Terraform configuration directory:
        terraform init
- Create an execution plan:
        terraform plan
- Create or modify the deployment:
        terraform apply

## Example for terraform.tfvars
```
// --- VPC Network Configuration ---
vpc_id = "vpc-12345678"
cluster_vswitch_id = "vsw-01234"
mgmt_vswitch_id = "vsw-34567"
private_vswitch_id = "vsw-56789"
private_route_table = "vtb-12345678"

// --- ECS Instance Configuration ---
gateway_name = "Check-Point-Cluster-tf"
gateway_instance_type = "ecs.g5ne.xlarge"
key_name = "privatekey"
allocate_and_associate_eip = true
volume_size = 100
ram_role_name = "role_name"
instance_tags = {
  key1 = "value1"
  key2 = "value2"
}

// --- Check Point Settings ---
gateway_version = "R81-BYOL"
admin_shell = "/bin/bash"
gateway_SICKey = "12345678"
gateway_password_hash = "12345678"

// --- Advanced Settings ---
resources_tag_name = "tag-name"
gateway_hostname = "gw-hostname"
allow_upload_download = true
gateway_bootstrap_script = "echo 12345678"
primary_ntp = "123.456.789.123"
secondary_ntp = "abc.def.ghi.jkl"

```

## Conditional creation
- To create an Elastic IP for each Cluster member and associate it to the Security Gateway instances:
```
allocate_and_associate_eip = true
```
- To create a default route to the Active Cluster member, fill the private_route_table variable:
```
private_route_table = "rtb-12345678"
```
- To create a cluster RAM role for your Cluster instances with the required permissions for Cluster behavior, leave the ram_role_name variable empty:
```
ram_role_name = ""
```

## Outputs
| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| cluster_primary_EIP  | Cluster Primary EIP |
| cluster_secondary_EIP  | Cluster secondary EIP |
