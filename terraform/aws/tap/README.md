# Check Point Traffic Access Point (TAP) Terraform module for AWS

Terraform module which deploys a TAP solution in an existing VPC on AWS.

To learn about Check Point's TAP solution, click [here](CheckPoint_NOW_onboarding_page.pdf).


These types of Terraform resources are supported:
* [AWS Instance](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html) - TAP Gateway
* [AWS CloudFormation Stack](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/cloudformation_stack.html) - creates Traffic Mirror Filter and Target 
* [AWS Lambdas](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_function.html) - TAP Lambda, TAP Termination Lambda

Learn more about [TAP Lambda](#TAP-Lambda) and [TAP Termination Lambda](#TAP-Termination-Lambda)

This solution uses the following modules:
- /terraform/aws/modules/amis


## Prerequisites
* **Internet Gateway -** The VPC deployed into **must** have an [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) 
configured as default route in the VPC's main route-table in order to allow communication between the TAP Gateway and Check Point NOW Cloud.
**Note:** Internet connectivity is mandatory pre-deployment.
* **License -** This module supports Check Point R80.40 NGTX-PAYG license only
* **NOW domain and Cyber Sentry -** 
To create a NOW domain fill in the [NOW cloud registration form](https://now.checkpoint.com/register/index.html).
Once you are logged in to your NOW domain, create a Cyber Sentry and use its MAC address as the 'registration_key' variable in the terraform deployment.
For detailed information and instructions refer to the [NOW onboarding page](CheckPoint_NOW_onboarding_page.pdf).

> **Note:** Make sure the Cyber Sentry you intend to connect to is 'decativated' pre-deployment in the NOW portal.

### Notes and limitations
* As explained in [AWS Traffic Mirroring considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-considerations.html) page,
AWS supports traffic mirroring for [Nitro-based instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) only.
* Post-deployment refer to [Check Point NOW portal](https://now.checkpoint.com) > Cyber Sentries. 
Once your Cyber sentry changes its state to 'activated' and 'connected' - the instance connected successfully to Check Point NOW Cloud. 
This may take up to 20 minutes.
* Due to an AWS limitation the **maximum number of mirror sources per target** depends on the TAP Gateway instance type.
For a non-dedicated instance type as target, the limit is 10 sources.
For a dedicated instance type, the limit is 100 sources.
CGI supports the following dedicated instance types: c5.18xlarge and c5n.18xlarge
For more information please refer to [AWS Traffic Mirroring quotas and considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-considerations.html#traffic-mirroring-limits) page.

## Note
The **main.tf** file includes the following provider configuration block used to configure the credentials for the authentication with AWS, as well as a default region for your resources:
```
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
  access_key = var.access_key
  secret_key = var.secret_key
}
```
The provider credentials can be provided either as static credentials or as [Environment Variables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables).
- Static credentials can be provided by adding an access_key and secret_key in /terraform/aws/tap/**terraform.tfvars** file as follows:
```
region     = "us-east-1"
access_key = "my-access-key"
secret_key = "my-secret-key"
```
- In case the Environment Variables are used, perform modifications described below:<br/>
  a. The next lines in main.tf file, in the provider aws resource, need to be commented:
  ```
  provider "aws" {
  //  region = var.region
  //  access_key = var.access_key
  //  secret_key = var.secret_key
  }
  ```

## Usage
[Clone or download](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/CloudGuardIaaS) Check Point CloudGuard Network Github Repository.

Configure your variables in /terraform/aws/tap/**terraform.tfvars** file as follows:
```
// --- VPC Network Configuration ---
vpc_id = "vpc-12345678"
external_subnet_id = "subnet-abc123"
internal_subnet_id = "subnet-def456"
resources_tag_name = "env1"

// --- TAP Configuration ---
registration_key = "10:10:10:10:10:10"
vxlan_id = 10
blacklist_tags = {
  env = "staging"
  state = "stable"
}
schedule_scan_interval = 60

// --- EC2 Instance Configuration ---
instance_name = "tap-gateway"
instance_type = "c5.xlarge"
key_name = "privatekey"
```
**main.tf** - Refers to the above configured variables and does not require any changes:
```
provider "aws" {
    region = var.region
    access_key = var.access_key
    secret_key = var.secret_key
}

module "tap" {
  source = "../../modules/tap"

  // --- VPC Network Configuration ---
  vpc_id = var.vpc_id
  external_subnet_id = var.external_subnet_id
  internal_subnet_id = var.internal_subnet_id
  resources_tag_name = var.resources_tag_name

  // --- TAP Configuration ---
  registration_key = var.registration_key
  vxlan_id = var.vxlan_id
  blacklist_tags = var.blacklist_tags
  schedule_scan_interval = var.schedule_scan_interval

  // --- EC2 Instance Configuration ---
  instance_name = var.instance_name
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name = var.key_name
}
```
From your tap directory's command line -
* Run 'terraform plan' to generate and show an execution plan
* Run 'terraform apply' to initiate deployment and build the TAP infrastructure
* Run 'terraform destroy' to destroy the terraform-managed infrastructure

> Find Terraform commands doc [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html).

This module creates a Check Point TAP Gateway instance in the VPC specified by the user, 
along with traffic mirror filter and target, and two lambda functions: TAP Lambda and TAP Termination Lambda.

Once the Check Point TAP Gateway instance is deployed, the TAP Lambda is invoked and scans the entire 
VPC for mirrorable NITRO instances.

## Deployment

First, purchase a [CloudGuard Network security gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07LB54LFB?qid=1586153579302&sr=0-2&ref_=srh_res_product_title) 
with Threat Prevention & SandBlast from the AWS marketplace. 
A named customer domain must be provisioned on the Check Point now.checkpoint.com SaaS – 
during the Early Availability period, this must be performed by Check Point. 
To create a NOW domain fill in the [NOW cloud registration form](https://now.checkpoint.com/register/index.html) and your request will be handled as soon as possible.
You will receive an email with a registration link – click that, and a certificate will be automatically generated and provided to you for download and import into your browser.
(Note: some browsers, e.g. Google Chrome, require a restart for the certificate to be activated – kill all instances of the browser, and restart it.)
Now point your browser at [now.checkpoint.com](https://now.checkpoint.com). You will be directed into your new domain.
Go to the Management > Sentries tab and click 'New'
* The New Sentry pane will open – select 'Virtual’, enter an optional description, verify the time zone, and click ADD
* A new sentry entry will appear. It will be uniquely identified by automatically generated 'Name’ and 'MAC Address’
* Download the CloudGuard Network TAP Terraform module from [CloudGuard Network Github - TAP module](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/CloudGuardIaaS/tree/master/terraform/aws/modules/tap).
Edit terraform.tfvars file according to the instructions in the [Usage](#Usage) section above, using the sentry’s 'MAC Address’ for the registration_key variable.
* Launch the module using Terraform. As described above, this module creates a Check Point TAP Gateway instance in the VPC specified by the user, along with traffic mirror filter and target, and two lambda functions: 'TAP Lambda' and 'TAP Termination Lambda'. Once the Check Point CloudGuard Network TAP Gateway instance is deployed, the TAP Lambda is invoked and scans the entire VPC for mirrorable NITRO instances that meet the configured selection criteria.
* After up to 20 minutes, the sentry state will change to “Connected” in the NOW portal.
Check the Logs tab to see that network traffic is flowing into the sentry.

### TAP Lambda

#### IAM role
The module creates an IAM role for the TAP Lambda, named 'chkp_iam_tap_lambda' suffixed with a uuid.
This role is granted minimum permissions for the Lambda to execute.

#### Responsibilities

1. Invoked by Terraform once the Check Point TAP Gateway instance is deployed.
    1. Scans the VPC for mirrorable instances
    2. Creates traffic mirror sessions between the TAP Gateway traffic mirror target 
    and the primary ENI of non-blacklisted instances
    3. Skips traffic mirror session creation for blacklisted instances

2. Invoked by an EC2 event: Every instance in the VPC that changes its state to 'Running'.
    1. Updates TAP for triggered instance - If not blacklisted and not TAPed, 
    creates traffic mirror session to the TAP Gateway traffic mirror target.
    If blacklisted and TAPed, deletes traffic mirror session with the TAP Gateway target
    2. Scans VPC and updates TAP for all mirrorable instances (see 2.i)
 
3. Invoked by a scheduled event: every X minutes, configured by the 'schedule_scan_interval' variable (default = 60).
    1. Scans the VPC for mirrorable instances
    2. Updates TAP for all mirrorable instances in the VPC (see 2.i)


#### Instances blacklisting:

This module supports tag based blacklist mechanism to avoid TAP for desired instances. 

The Terraform TAP module holds a 'blacklist_tags' variable of type map(string).
The 'blacklist_tags' variable consists of key value pairs representing tag-key and tag-value pairs. 

The TAP Lambda will create traffic mirror sessions only for instances which **do not** hold any of 
these tag pairs. Instances with any of these tag pairs will not be TAPed by the TAP Lambda function. 
If a blacklisted instance is already TAPed, the TAP Lambda will act accordingly and 
delete the traffic mirror session.

During the solution deployment, the 'blacklist_tags' variable's values are joined to a string in the
following structure: "key1=value1:key2-value2:key3=value3" and so on.
This string is passed as 'TAP_BLACKLIST' environment variable to the TAP Lambda.
You can update the blacklist tags list by editing the TAP Lambda 'TAP_BLACKLIST' environment variable.
The structure "key1=value1:key2-value2:key3=value3" of the variable must be maintained.


### TAP Termination Lambda
 
 This Lambda should be manually invoked **prior** to destroying the Terraform environment.
 The environment destruction **will fail** if skipping the Termination Lambda invocation.

#### IAM role
The module creates an IAM role for the TAP Termination Lambda, named 'chkp_iam_tap_termination_lambda' suffixed with a uuid.
This role is granted minimum permissions for the Lambda to execute.
 
#### Responsibilities:
 
Lambda deletes <u>all</u> traffic mirror sessions associated with the TAP Gateway's target.
This step is crucial before environment destruction in order for destruction to finish successfully
(an alternative way is to navigate to AWS traffic mirror sessions page and manually 
delete the relevant sessions).
