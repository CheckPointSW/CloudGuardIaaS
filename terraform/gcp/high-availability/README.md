# Check Point Cluster High Availability (HA) Terraform module for GCP

Terraform module which deploys Check Point CloudGuard IaaS High Availability solution on GCP.

These types of Terraform resources are supported:
* [Network](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/d/compute_network.html) - conditional creation
* [Subnetwork](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_subnetwork.html) - conditional creation
* [Instance](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance)
* [IP address](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/compute_address)
* [Firewall](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_firewall.html) - conditional creation


See Check Point's documentation for Cluster High Availability (HA) [here](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/IaaS/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_CloudGuard_IaaS_HighAvailabilty_for_GCP/Default.htm)

This solution uses the following modules:
- \gcp\common\network-and-subnet
- \gcp\common\firewall-rule
- \gcp\common\cluster-member
- \gcp\common\members-a-b

Terraform is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Terraform is only a single command-line application: **terraform**. 

## Before you begin
1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and set up billing on that project.
2. [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and read the Terraform getting started guide that follows. This guide will assume basic proficiency with Terraform - it is an introduction to the Google provider.

## Configuring the Provider
The **main.tf** file includes the following provider configuration block used to configure the credentials you use to authenticate with GCP, as well as a default project and location for your resources:
```
provider "google" {
  credentials = file(var.service_account_path)
  project     = var.project
  region      = var.region
}
...
```
1. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) (or use the existing one). Next, download the JSON key file. Name it something you can remember and store it somewhere secure on your machine. <br/>
2. Select "Editor" Role or verify you have the following permissions:
    ```
    compute.addresses.create
    compute.addresses.delete
    compute.addresses.get
    compute.addresses.use
    compute.disks.create
    compute.firewalls.create
    compute.firewalls.delete
    compute.firewalls.get
    compute.images.get
    compute.images.useReadOnly
    compute.instances.create
    compute.instances.delete
    compute.instances.get
    compute.instances.setMetadata
    compute.instances.setServiceAccount
    compute.instances.setTags
    compute.networks.create
    compute.networks.delete
    compute.networks.get
    compute.networks.updatePolicy
    compute.regions.list
    compute.subnetworks.create
    compute.subnetworks.delete
    compute.subnetworks.get
    compute.subnetworks.use
    compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp
    compute.zones.get
    iam.serviceAccountKeys.get
    iam.serviceAccountKeys.list
    iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
    iam.serviceAccounts.get
    iam.serviceAccounts.list
    ```
3. ```credentials``` - Your service account key file is used to complete a two-legged OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain access tokens to authenticate with the GCP API as needed; Terraform will use it to reauthenticate automatically when tokens expire. <br/> 
The provider credentials can be provided either as static credentials or as [Environment Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#credentials-1).
    - Static credentials can be provided by adding the path to your service-account json file, project-name and region in /gcp/modules/high-availability/**terraform.tfvars** file as follows:
        ```
        service_account_path = "service-accounts/service-account-file-name.json"
        project = "project-name"
        region = "us-central1"
        ```
     - In case the Environment Variables are used, perform modifications described below:<br/>
        a. The next lines in the main.tf file, in the provider google resource, need to be deleted or commented:
        ```
        provider "google" {
          //  credentials = file(var.service_account_path)
          //  project = var.project
       
          region = var.region
        }
       ```
       b.In the terraform.tfvars file leave empty double quotes for credentials and project variables:
       ```
       service_account_path = ""
       project = ""
       ```
    ## Usage
- Fill all variables in the /gcp/high-availability/**terraform.tfvars** file with proper values (see below for variables descriptions).
- From a command line initialize the Terraform configuration directory:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
- Create an execution plan:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
- Create or modify the deployment:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
  
#### Variables are configured in high-availability/**terraform.tfvars** file as follows:
```
# --- Google Provider ---
service_account_path = "service-accounts/service-account-file-name.json"
project = "project-name"

# --- Check Point Deployment ---
prefix = "chkp-tf-ha"
license = "BYOL"

machine_type = "n1-standard-4"
disk_type = "SSD Persistent Disk"
disk_size = 100
admin_SSH_key = "ssh-rsa xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx imported-openssh-key"
enable_monitoring = false

# --- Check Point ---
management_network = "209.87.209.100/32"
sic_key = "aaaaaaaa"
generate_password = false
allow_upload_download = false
admin_shell = "/bin/bash"

# --- Networking ---
cluster_network_cidr = "10.0.1.0/24"

mgmt_ICMP_traffic = []
mgmt_TCP_traffic = []
mgmt_UDP_traffic = []
mgmt_SCTP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
mgmt_ESP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
num_internal_networks = 1
internal_network1_cidr = "10.0.3.0/24"
internal_network1_name = ""
internal_network1_subnetwork_name = ""

```

- To tear down your resources:
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
 

## Conditional creation
<br>1. For each network and subnet variable, you can choose whether to create a new network with a new subnet or to use an existing one.
- If you want to create a new network and subnet, please input a subnet CIDR block for the desired new network - In this case, the network name and subnetwork name will not be used:
```
    cluster_network_cidr = "10.0.1.0/24"
    cluster_network_name = "not-use"
    cluster_network_subnetwork_name = "not-use"
```
- Otherwise, if you want to use existing network and subnet, please leave empty double quotes in the CIDR variable for the desired network:
```
    cluster_network_cidr = ""
    cluster_network_name = "cluster-network"
    cluster_network_subnetwork_name = "cluster-subnetwork"
```
<br>2. To create Firewall and allow traffic for ICMP, TCP, UDP, SCTP or/and ESP - enter list of Source IP ranges.
<br>Please leave empty list for a protocol if you want to disable traffic for it.
- For cluster:
```
    cluster_ICMP_traffic = ["123.123.0.0/24", "234.234.0.0/24"]
    cluster_TCP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    cluster_UDP_traffic = []
    cluster_SCTP_traffic = []
    cluster_ESP_traffic = []
```
- For management:
```
    mgmt_ICMP_traffic = ["123.123.0.0/24", "234.234.0.0/24"]
    mgmt_TCP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    mgmt_UDP_traffic = []
    mgmt_SCTP_traffic = []
    mgmt_ESP_traffic = []
```
<br>3.The cluster members will each have a network interface in each internal network and create high priority routes that will route all outgoing traffic to the cluster member that is currently active.
<br>Using internal networks depends on the variable num_internal_networks, by selecting a number in range 1 - 6 that represents the number of internal networks:
```
    num_internal_networks = 3
    internal_network1_cidr = ""
    internal_network1_name = "internal_network1"
    internal_network1_subnetwork_name = "internal_subnetwork1"
    internal_network2_cidr = "10.0.4.0/24"
    internal_network2_name = ""
    internal_network2_subnetwork_name = ""
    internal_network3_cidr = "10.0.5.0/24"
    internal_network3_name = ""
    internal_network3_subnetwork_name = ""
```
