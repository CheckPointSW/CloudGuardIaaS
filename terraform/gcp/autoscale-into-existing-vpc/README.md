# Check Point Autoscale into VPC (MIG) Terraform module for GCP

Terraform module which deploys an Auto Scaling Group of Check Point Security Gateways into an existing VPC on GCP.

These types of Terraform resources are supported:
* [Instance Template](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance_template.html)
* [Firewall](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_firewall.html) - conditional creation
* [Instance Group Manager](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_region_instance_group_manager.html)
* [Autoscaler](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_region_autoscaler.html)


See Check Point's documentation for Autoscale (MIG) [here](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R80.30/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R80.30_and_Above_CG_Autoscaling_Managed_Instance_Group_for_GCP/AdminGuide/Content/Overview.htm)

Terraform is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Terraform is only a single command-line application: **terraform**. 

## Before you begin
1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and set up billing on that project.
2. [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and read the Terraform getting started guide that follows. This guide will assume basic proficiency with Terraform - it is an introduction to the Google provider.

## Configuring the Provider
The **main.tf** file includes the following provider configuration block used to configure the credentials you use to authenticate with GCP, as well as a default project and location for your resources:
```
provider "google" {
  credentials = file(var.service_account_path)
  project     = var.project
  region      = var.region
}
...
```

1. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) (or use the existing one). Next, download the JSON key file. Name it something you can remember and store it somewhere secure on your machine. <br/>
2. Select "Editor" Role or verify you have the following permissions:
   ```
   compute.autoscalers.create
   compute.autoscalers.delete
   compute.autoscalers.get
   compute.disks.create
   compute.disks.delete
   compute.firewalls.create
   compute.firewalls.delete
   compute.firewalls.get
   compute.images.get
   compute.images.useReadOnly
   compute.instanceGroupManagers.create
   compute.instanceGroupManagers.delete
   compute.instanceGroupManagers.get
   compute.instanceGroupManagers.use
   compute.instanceTemplates.create
   compute.instanceTemplates.delete
   compute.instanceTemplates.get
   compute.instanceTemplates.useReadOnly
   compute.instances.create
   compute.instances.delete
   compute.instances.setMetadata
   compute.instances.setTags
   compute.networks.get
   compute.networks.updatePolicy
   compute.regions.list
   compute.subnetworks.get
   compute.subnetworks.use
   compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp
   iam.serviceAccountKeys.get
   iam.serviceAccountKeys.list
   iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
   iam.serviceAccounts.get
   iam.serviceAccounts.list
   ```
3. ```credentials``` - Your service account key file is used to complete a two-legged OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain access tokens to authenticate with the GCP API as needed; Terraform will use it to reauthenticate automatically when tokens expire. <br/> 
The provider credentials can be provided either as static credentials or as [Environment Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#credentials-1).
    - Static credentials can be provided by adding the path to your service-account json file, project-name and region in /gcp/modules/autoscale-into-new-vpc/**terraform.tfvars** file as follows:
        ```
        service_account_path = "service-accounts/service-account-file-name.json"
        project = "project-name"
        region = "us-central1"
        ```
     - In case the Environment Variables are used, perform modifications described below:<br/>
        a. The next lines in the main.tf file, in the provider google resource, need to be deleted or commented:
        ```
        provider "google" {
          //  credentials = file(var.service_account_path)
          //  project = var.project
       
          region = var.region
        }
       ```
       b.In the terraform.tfvars file leave empty double quotes for credentials and project variables:
       ```
       service_account_path = ""
       project = ""
       ```
## Usage
- Fill all variables in the /gcp/autoscale-into-existing-vpc/**terraform.tfvars** file with proper values (see below for variables descriptions).
- From a command line initialize the Terraform configuration directory:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
- Create an execution plan:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
- Create or modify the deployment:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    ```

## Conditional creation
To create Firewall and allow traffic for ICMP, TCP, UDP, SCTP or/and ESP - enter list of Source IP ranges.
```
ICMP_traffic = ["123.123.0.0/24", "234.234.0.0/24"]
