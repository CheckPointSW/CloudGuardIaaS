# Check Point single gateway and management Terraform module for GCP

Terraform module which deploys a single gateway and management of Check Point Security Gateways.

These types of Terraform resources are supported:
 [Instance Template](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance_template.html)
 [Firewall](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_firewall.html) - conditional creation
 [Instance Group Manager](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_region_instance_group_manager.html)
 [Compute instance](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance)


See Check Point's documentation for Single [here](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk114577)

Terraform is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Terraform is only a single command-line application: terraform. 

## Before you begin
1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and set up billing on that project.
2. [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and read the Terraform getting started guide that follows. This guide will assume basic proficiency with Terraform - it is an introduction to the Google provider.

## Configuring the Provider
The main.tf file includes the following provider configuration block used to configure the credentials you use to authenticate with GCP, as well as a default project and location for your resources:
```
provider "google" {
  credentials = file(var.service_account_path)
  project     = var.project
}
...
```

1. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) (or use the existing one). Next, download the JSON key file. Name it something you can remember and store it somewhere secure on your machine. <br/>
2. Select "Editor" Role or verify you have the following permissions:
   ```
    compute.addresses.get
    compute.addresses.use
    compute.addresses.create
    compute.disks.create
    compute.disks.delete
    compute.firewalls.create
    compute.firewalls.delete
    compute.firewalls.get
    compute.images.get
    compute.images.useReadOnly
    compute.images.getFromFamily
    compute.instanceTemplates.create
    compute.instanceTemplates.delete
    compute.instanceTemplates.get
    compute.instanceTemplates.useReadOnly
    compute.instances.addAccessConfig
    compute.instances.create
    compute.instances.delete
    compute.instances.get
    compute.instances.setMetadata
    compute.instances.setTags
    compute.instances.setLabels
    compute.networks.get
    compute.networks.updatePolicy
    compute.regions.list
    compute.subnetworks.get
    compute.subnetworks.use
    compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp
    compute.zones.get
    iam.serviceAccountKeys.get
    iam.serviceAccountKeys.list
    iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
    iam.serviceAccounts.get
    iam.serviceAccounts.list
    iam.serviceAccounts.set
   ```
3. ```credentials``` - Your service account key file is used to complete a two-legged OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain access tokens to authenticate with the GCP API as needed; Terraform will use it to reauthenticate automatically when tokens expire. <br/> 
The provider credentials can be provided either as static credentials or as [Environment Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#credentials-1).
    - Static credentials can be provided by adding the path to your service-account json file, project-name and region in /gcp/modules/single/terraform.tfvars file as follows:
        ```
        service_account_path = "service-accounts/service-account-file-name.json"
        project = "project-name"
        ```
     - In case the Environment Variables are used, perform modifications described below:<br/>
        a. The next lines in the main.tf file, in the provider google resource, need to be deleted or commented:
        ```
        provider "google" {
          //  credentials = file(var.service_account_path)
          //  project = var.project
       
        }
       ```
       b.In the terraform.tfvars file leave empty double quotes for credentials and project variables:
       ```
       service_account_path = ""
       project = ""
       ```
## Usage
- Fill all variables in the /gcp/single/terraform.tfvars file with proper values (see below for variables descriptions).
- From a command line initialize the Terraform configuration directory:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
- Create an execution plan:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
- Create or modify the deployment:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
  
#### Variables are configured in single/terraform.tfvars file as follows:
```
# --- Google Provider ---
service_account_path = "service-accounts/service-account-file-name.json"
project = "project-name"

# --- Check Point---
image_name = "check-point-r8110-gw-byol-single-335-985-v20220126"
installationType = "Gateway only"
license = "BYOL"
prefix = "chkp-single-tf-"
management_nic = "Ephemeral Public IP (eth0)"
admin_shell = "/etc/cli.sh"
admin_SSH_key = "ssh-rsa xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx imported-openssh-key"
generatePassword = false
allow_upload_download = true
sicKey = ""
managementGUIClientNetwork = "0.0.0.0/0"

# --- Networking ---

# --- Instance Configuration ---
machine_type = "n1-standard-4"
diskType = "SSD Persistent Disk"
bootDiskSizeGb = 100
enableMonitoring = false

```

- To tear down your resources:
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```

## Conditional creation
To create Firewall and allow traffic for ICMP, TCP, UDP, SCTP or/and ESP - enter list of Source IP ranges.
```
ICMP_traffic = ["123.123.0.0/24", "234.234.0.0/24"]
TCP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
UDP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
SCTP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
ESP_traffic = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
```
Please leave empty list for a protocol if you want to disable traffic for it.
