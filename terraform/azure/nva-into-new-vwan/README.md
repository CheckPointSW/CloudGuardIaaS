# Check Point CloudGuard Network Security Virtual WAN Terraform deployment for Azure - Public Preview

This Terraform module deploys Check Point CloudGuard Network Security vWAN NVA solution into a new vWAN Hub in Azure.
As part of the deployment the following resources are created:
- Resource groups
- Virtual WAN
- Virtual WAN Hub
- Azure Managed Application:
  - NVA
  - Managed identity



## Configurations
- Install and configure Terraform to provision Azure resources: [Configure Terraform for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure).
- In order to configure hub routing-intent policies it is **required** to have Python and 'requests' library installed.

## Usage
- Choose the preferred login method to Azure in order to deploy the solution:
    <br>1. Using Service Principal:
    - Create a [Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) (or use the existing one) 
    - Grant the Service Principal at least "**Contributor**" permissions to the Azure subscription<br>
    - The Service Principal credentials can be stored either in the terraform.tfvars or as [Environment Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azuread/guides/service_principal_client_secret.html)<br>
    
      In case the Environment Variables are used, perform modifications described below:<br>
      
       a. The next lines in the versions.tf file, in the provider azurerm resource,  need to be deleted or commented:
            
                provider "azurerm" {
                 
                //  subscription_id = var.subscription_id
                //  client_id = var.client_id
                //  client_secret = var.client_secret
                //  tenant_id = var.tenant_id
                
                   features {}
                }
            
        b. In the terraform.tfvars file leave empty double quotes for client_secret, client_id , tenant_id and subscription_id variables:
        
                client_secret                   = ""
                client_id                       = ""
                tenant_id                       = ""
                subscription_id                 = "" 
        
    <br>2. Using **az** commands from a command-line:
    - Run  **az login** command 
    - Sign in with your account credentials in the browser
    - In the terraform.tfvars file leave empty double quotes for client_secret, client_id and tenant_id variables. 
 
- Fill all variables in the /terraform/azure/nva-into-new-vwan/terraform.tfvars file with proper values (see below for variables descriptions).
- From a command line initialize the Terraform configuration directory:

        terraform init
- Create an execution plan:
 
        terraform plan
- Create or modify the deployment:
 
        terraform apply
