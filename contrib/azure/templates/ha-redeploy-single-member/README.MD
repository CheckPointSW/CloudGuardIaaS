# ARM CloudGuard High Availability template to redeploy Cluster member

This directory contains the CloudGuard IaaS HA template derived from the ´20220130` version of the template .

This template adds the ability to redeploy a single member of a HA cluster into the same Resource Group of an existing Ha cluster withouth the need to redeploy the whole cluster. 

The template is specially useful in the following use cases:
1 - Redeploy/Replace a single memeber of a cluster that has failed on the same version.
2 - Perform an upgrade of the Cluster using MVC (Multi-version cluster)


The logic of the template is to simply replace one VM and re-attach the old NIC’s and Public addresses and deploy on the same resource group as the old VM. 

NOTE 1: IAM roles must be configured manually since the template fails to update the resource group.

NOTE 2: Deploys a new Storage account dedicated to the new deployed VM.

## How to deploy the template:

Note: Backup device according to sk169814 (if possible).
